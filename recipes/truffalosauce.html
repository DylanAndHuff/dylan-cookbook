    <h4>A jar of freshly homemade Buffalo sauce. </h4>
    &nbsp;
    <p>In my experience, buffalo sauce is always best when fresh made at home. The flavors are more robust and the satisfaction of crafting a sauce yourself is worth it in-and-of itself. The following recipe is a modification of a buffalo sauce that I found on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219109/buffalo-chicken-wing-sauce/">allrecipes</a> that I have used a few times. I enjoyed the sauce and it was super simple to make, but I wanted to replace some of the butter with healthier alternatives as well as put some of my own personal tweaks into it. I present to you Truffalo Wing Sauce.</p>

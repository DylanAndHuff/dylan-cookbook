    <h4>Loaded nachos with a large variety of toppings. </h4>
    &nbsp;
    <p>Nachos is a dish that everyone has tried and is an American favorite. I'm not fully satisfied by any old batch of nachos though, I must have variety! I have a rule of thumb that a chip with toppings is just that, a chip, not a nacho! I like to add flavored chips, like doritos as well and multiple layers and a ton of toppings. When complete it looks more akin to a casserole than nachos. This is a a favorite in my household and is both delicious and filling (although maybe not healthy :P). </p>
